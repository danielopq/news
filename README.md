## Overview

This project involved developing a responsive frontend for an IT news website landing page, optimized for seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout and design elements were carefully structured based on the provided mockups, ensuring consistency and ease of navigation across devices. Key components were implemented using CSS Grid to streamline transitions between desktop and mobile views, enabling an adaptable layout that efficiently scales down to smaller screens without losing functionality or aesthetic quality.

The entire website was built from scratch using only HTML and CSS, with no reliance on frameworks or external libraries. This approach allowed for greater customization, reduced load times, and fine-tuned control over the responsive behavior of each element. The result is a clean, lightweight, and user-friendly website that provides a smooth experience for IT news readers on any device.

## My process

The website was initially designed and developed for the desktop experience. After completing the desktop version and ensuring all elements met the design specifications and functional requirements, I proceeded to create a mobile-friendly version. This adaptation was achieved solely through the use of CSS media queries, allowing the site to maintain its visual coherence and usability across a range of screen sizes.

The mobile adaptation involved restructuring and resizing specific components to enhance readability and ease of navigation on smaller screens. This approach allowed for a seamless transition from desktop to mobile without sacrificing performance or design integrity, resulting in a fully responsive website that provides an optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
